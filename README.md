# blood_donation_communication_database
Project Description:
We are going to create a platform where people can donate their blood to save people's lives as
well as people can get blood for any patient without any cost. We will develop social bonding
with people in this platform where people help each-others from their social responsibility.
Where vulnerable people will get help very easily without any money. So our main agenda is to
help people who need blood for emergencies making social connectivity in our society.
